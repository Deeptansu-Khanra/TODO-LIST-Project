# TODO-LIST-Project


This to-do list project is made using HTML,CSS,Javascript and PHP. The database is connected using mysql(PHPmyadmin). I had used local storage
to store the tasks in the to-do list so it works on mostly all browsers. You can signup and login to the website to start
using the To do list. There is also a blog page where you can find blogs on journaling and productivity.
